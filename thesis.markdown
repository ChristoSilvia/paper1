Although women were rarely manly themselves, they had the power
to dicate the boundaries of manliness.  During a feud, it was a
man's decision to accept an honorable settlement or continue taking
blood vengence.  Icelandic women could insult a man's manliness in accepting
an honorable settlement, and often encouraged the cycle of blood vengence.
