Although women were rarely manly themselves, they had the power
to dicate the boundaries of manliness.  During a feud, it was a
man's decision to accept an honorable settlement or continue taking
blood vengence.  Icelandic women could insult a man's manliness in accepting
an honorable settlement, and often encouraged the cycle of blood vengence.

It's definiely not manly for a death to go unsettled, or for an insult to go unpunished.
It's possible to think of the social as maintained by who can insult whom and get away with it.  Insults are social markers, and status symbols, so they are taken extremely seriously.  Both men and women can insult each other, though many women insult men by questioning their manliness.
