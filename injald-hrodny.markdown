Saga women do not only incite men to violence or vengence, sometimes they seek to prevent violence.
After the band that would become the burners agrees on a date to meet, a man named Ingjald rides to meet his sister Hrodny.
Hrodny has had a child with Njal, and feels a great degree of loyalty towards him.  
Ingjald feels loyal to Njal as well, for Njal has helped him out of difficulty many times.
However, Ingjald is married to Flosi's brother's daughter. 
Afer the slaying of Hoskuld, Flosi approaches Ingjald and demands support from him and his band of men.
At first, Ingjald attempts to parry Flosi's request, saying that his friendship with Njal is in the way, but Flosi rebukes him: "'I thought, when I married you to my brother's daughter, that you promised to support me in all things'"(116).
Flosi is invoking Ingjald's wedding vows, and is accusing him of disloyalty. However, Ingjald is in an impossible position, since he is committed to both Flosi and Njal.  
Flosi knows that one of the loyalties will win out, and he is moving to try and consolidate his support, and remind him of the oaths that bind them together.
Reminding Ingjald of his shared loyalties may not win him over, but it will make him think twice about supporting Njal with his men.

Once Flosi refused the settlement, he rides to his sister Hrodny, who was once married to Njal.
