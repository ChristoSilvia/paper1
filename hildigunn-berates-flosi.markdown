Flosi and his band of men have been riding around through the farms, gathering news about the aftermath of the slaying of Hoskuld.  
As soon as they return to Hoskuld's home, Hoskuld's wife Hildigunn prepares an elaborate feast for Flosi and his band of men.  
Flosi seems to suggest that he's insulted by the preparations, saying that there's "no need to fix up the high seat for me, and no need to make fun of me."(116)
Flosi might be suggesting that Hildigunn is showing off Hoskuld's wealth and importance by putting on this elaborate feast.  
He lets Hildigunn know that he realizes what she's doing, and tries to humble himself.
Flosi's intuition serves him well, for the first recorded words he hears from Hildigunn are: "'What action can I expect from you for the slaying, and what support"'"(116).
Hildigunn has shown without words that Hoskuld was an important and valuable man.  She immediately and pragmatically moves to consolidate Flosi's supprort.
In response, Flosi pledges less than full support.  He only promises to prosecute the case to the full extent of the law, or obtain an honorable settlement.
By pledging to prosecute the case to the full extent of the law, Flosi is denying Hildigunn blood vengence.  Flosi is familiar with feuds, and he knows that the pledge of vengence that Hildigunn wants will lead to many deaths.  Flosi wants to avoid promising vengence, for his safety, and the safety of his men.
